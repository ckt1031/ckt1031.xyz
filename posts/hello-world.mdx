## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog! I come from Hong Kong and I am an energetic boy who loves architecture, especially computers and buildings. I started this site in June 2022 and I hope you will keep following my blog. üòÄ

## Reason for making this website

I love talking and discussing things in real life and on the internet. In addition, I also enjoy sharing my experiences with others. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Expectations

As we head into 2023, I hope to write at least one post per week. However, I am currently preparing for HKDSE and my studies are my top priority. I will make sure to balance my studies with extracurricular activities such as programming.

Another expectation of mine is to make more new friends in real life. Even though I am not alone, I want to do more to broaden my horizons and meet new people. Feel free to reach out if you want to make new friends! üòÄ
