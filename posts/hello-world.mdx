## Introduction

This is my first blog.
I come from Hong Kong, I am an energetic boy who loves architecture, especially computers and buildings.
As you see, I started this site in June 2022.
I will appreciate will you can keep following my blogüòÄ

## Reason that I made this website

I love talking and discussing in reality even on the internet.
In addition, I also love sharing things I have met in my life‚ù§Ô∏è

## Expectations

It's nearly 2023.

I hope I can make a post per week,
but I am F5 already, and that's the most important phase for preparing HKDSE. I make sure that I will balance studies and out-curriculum learning such as programming.

Another expectation is that I want to make more new friends in real life, actually, I am not alone but I want to do more to open my eyes, not even make new friends at school.
p.s. Free to make new friends üòÄ
